Below are some reasons why I would like you to consider me.
I know I dont have the right industry experience but I have developed significant fullstack projects.
While building them I have followed various industry practices talks to build reusable, efficient, asynchronous and well commented code.
I also have deep understanding of the javascript concurrency model based on the event loop.
I am highly obsessed with constantly improving my code and design quality.
I have a background in cybersecurity but I am a developer at heart and like to work on every stage of a application development. 
I have experience in API development and frontend frameworks mainly Vue.js and Angular.
I really enjoy this and like to proactively contribute.

Would like to hear from you.
